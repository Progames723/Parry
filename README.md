# Parry
It's no longer just fabric™!

## How to implement functionality
just use the `minecraft:swords` tag for your sword and you're good to go<p> 
this also adds some gameplay mechanics like `piercing` damage type that ignores ***absolutely anything*** defence related<p>
this includes creative invulnerability and magic(enchants and effects)
# The story behind this

I was inspired to make this mod from some other mods that added parrying,<p>
but they were out of date or didn't meet the mod loader requirements,<p> 
and that's how i made my own mod™

### please don't
please don't ask why did i add the ability to parry(block) ***anything***
